| Description | Capturing my first packet |  |  |
| Tool(s) used | For this activity, I used **tcpdump** to capture and analyze network traffic. Tcpdump is a command-line based network protocol analyzer. Like Wireshark, its value in cybersecurity lies in its ability to capture, filter, and examine network traffic, which assists security analysts in identifying and investigating potential threats. |  |  |

| Additional notes | As someone still new to the command-line interface, using it to capture and filter network traffic was initially a challenge. I ran into a few issues when I entered the wrong commands, which caused me to get stuck. However, by carefully following the instructions and redoing certain steps, I was eventually able to complete the activity successfully and capture network traffic. |  |  |
