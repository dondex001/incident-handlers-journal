| Description | Analyzing a packet capture file |  |  |
| Tool(s) used | For this activity, I utilized **Wireshark** to examine a packet capture file. Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer that provides a graphical user interface for ease of use. Its importance in cybersecurity lies in its ability to capture and inspect network traffic, enabling security analysts to detect and investigate potential malicious activity. |  |  |

| Additional notes | Since this was my first time using **Wireshark**, I was excited to begin the exercise and work with a packet capture file. At first, the interface felt overwhelming, but as I explored it, I began to understand why Wireshark is considered such a powerful tool for analyzing network traffic. |  |  |
